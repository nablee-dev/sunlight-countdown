Sunlight Countdown

* Shows the remaining hours/minutes of sunlight when there is sunlight
* Shows the remaining hours/minutes of darkness when there is no sunlight

Iteration 5 is my preference when displayed on a Kindle

This app was effectively made with LLM prompts. But it started to get hard to prompt the LLM to "add a 5 pixel margin below the line above the labels that describe the city and date". So minor styling was manually edited.
